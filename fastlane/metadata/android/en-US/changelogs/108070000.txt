# What's Changed

## Add QuickJS runtime

Implements yt-dlp's --js-runtimes command to help with many website challenges while fetching data and downloading.
Hopefully with this many of the current issues are resolved

- Upgrade to ffmpeg 7.1.1
- Fix hardcoded user id in path so it supports multiple users
- fix --cache-dir not properly formatted when used as command template
- Add toggle to always update yt-dlp before downloading
